# Infrastructure Overview

## Architecture

AIWAV's infrastructure is built on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform. The infrastructure is organized into modular components for flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.

### Modules

1. **Networking**
   - VPC configuration
   - Public and private subnets
   - Internet Gateway
   - NAT Gateway
   - Route tables and security groups

2. **Static Site**
   - S3 buckets for web and mobile applications
   - CloudFront distributions
   - ACM certificates for SSL/TLS
   - Origin Access Control
   - Bucket policies and versioning

3. **CI/CD**
   - CodeBuild projects
   - CodePipeline configurations
   - IAM roles and policies
   - Artifact storage
   - Build specifications

## Deployment Regions

- Primary: `us-east-1` (N. Virginia)
- Edge locations: Global CloudFront distribution

## Infrastructure Updates

1. **Development Process**
   - Create feature branch
   - Make infrastructure changes
   - Run `terraform plan`
   - Submit pull request
   - Review and approve
   - Merge and apply

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Run in terraform workspace
   - Apply with approval
   - Verify resources
   - Update documentation

## Security

1. **Access Control**
   - IAM roles and policies
   - Least privilege principle
   - MFA enforcement
   - Regular access reviews

2. **Data Protection**
   - S3 bucket encryption
   - CloudFront SSL/TLS
   - VPC security groups
   - Network ACLs

3. **Compliance**
   - Regular security audits
   - Compliance monitoring
   - Access logging
   - Resource tagging

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **CloudWatch**
   - Metrics collection
   - Log aggregation
   - Alarms and notifications
   - Dashboard monitoring

2. **Audit Trail**
   - CloudTrail logging
   - S3 access logs
   - VPC flow logs
   - API Gateway logs

## Cost Optimization

1. **Resource Management**
   - Right-sizing instances
   - Auto-scaling policies
   - Reserved instances
   - Spot instances where applicable

2. **Storage Optimization**
   - S3 lifecycle policies
   - EBS volume management
   - CloudFront caching
   - Data transfer optimization
